### Data Analysis
When examing the citi bike data, it seemed important to examine the first year of data (June 2013- June 2014) in order to get a snapshot of how citi bike was progressing in its first year. 
The total number of riders steadily increased during the 'good-weather' months and dropped off during winter months. One positive development was the comparison between June 2013 and June 2014.
June 2014 riders were up nearly triple compared to June 2013 which may predict a positive trend for the rest of 2014. One possible explination for this trend is the addition of the non-subscription based customers
which was not an option during June 2013.
	
The most popular hours of riding for both the summer and winter months was during rush hour (8AM and 5PM). This may suggest the riders are using the citi bike system to commute to and from work. Citi should capitalize 
on this trend and partner with businesses to offer employees rider membership. Besides drawing in more customers, It would create a positive green image which would benefit overall company image.

Though the citi bike program had a positive first year, one area of concern was the gender breakdown of riders, with men making up 65%-70% of total riders. In fact the total number of number men would likely increase if 
the number of unknown gender had specified gender. There is reason to believe that opportunity exists to increase the number of female riders in the future. However, without adequate data, it will be hard to find why the skew is the way that it is. Perhaps
it would be wise to conduct a survey of women to see why the number is low. This could be due to a number of factors, including but not limited to: safety, station-spacing, bike-design, terrain location, etc. More data must 
be acquired before proper steps can be taken.

The most sucessful stations (top 10) are primarily located in Manhattan with the worst performing stations (bottom-10) located in lower Manhattan and Brooklyn. However, due to the abundance of stations it is unknown whether a station's
performance is due to the socioeconomic situations of each area, or due to the oversaturation of stations. More research is required.

For the repair needs of bikes, I came up with a quick solution to guess if they were in need of repair. Since the max rides per month for the data set was 430, I estimated that bikes which had 215 rides or more were more likely in need 
of repair than bikes under that threshold. However, since the data set did not contain bike repair data, this is only a guess.

The twbx file was too large to push to github. <br>
The citi story was designed on a 27' 1440p monitor.
